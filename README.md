# Discovering an Algebraic Structure

### Project Overview
This project aims to discover an algebraic structure using a Neural Network.

### Base Algorithm
The base algorithm used for this project can be found in the Base.py file in the repository.

### Tools
In this project, we used:
* Python as the programming language,
* The PyTorch Library,
* Mathematical Modeling.

For this project, we used the base document "Abstract_vector_space.pdf" which is in the git repo.
The file base.py contains the implementation of the Neural Networks used to achieve the set objectives.

To reproduce the results of this project:
clone the git repo

- Create a virtual environment
```bash
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

```


- Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To buid the Project ,go to the directory and run 
```bash
cd chemin/vers/mon_projet/make
```


This will generate the PDF version of the Notebook with the obtained results.
The notebook contains two parts,
one with the variables for the test chosen according to a normal distribution and we reproduce the same results this time with $\alpha$ taken between -5 and 5.
