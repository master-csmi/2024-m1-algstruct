# Mathematical structure detection

## Objective 
Given a dataset $X=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ of points in $R^d$, and a choice of a mathematical structure (e.g. a group, vector space, ring, Lie Group, etc.), find the correponding laws such that the dataset could be equipped with this mathematical structure.
The difficulty is the formulation of the problem : how to design losses ?

## Subobjectives 

1. We will begin with one of the easiest math structure : the group.
2. Then, the vector space

## Why ?
Transform a nonlinear manifold into a vector space. Reduction modeling.
